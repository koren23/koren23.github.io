<div class="paragraph" id="explenation">
<p><u><b><div class="big">explenation</div></b></u><br><div class="small">ok so i started learning electronics for some reason (not school)<br>
im learning from youtube and ill try to write down the stuff i learned here to help me study it<br>
</div></p></div><br>
<div class="paragraph" id="ac-and-dc">
<p><u><b><div class="big">ac and dc</div></b></u><br><div class="small">ac aka alternating current is the electricity used in mass circles like inside the walls in your house<br>
ac is when electrones change their flow directions a lot<br>
dc aka direct current is used in small objects like a battery <br>
dc is defined when the electrones flow in a single direction without changing it<br>
note that dc can be converted to ac and ac can be converted to dc<br>
like in a computer the ac coming from the power plug is converted to dc that runs in the computer<br>
from now and on we'll focus on dc
</div></p></div><br>
<div class="paragraph" id="circuit">
<p><u><b><div class="big">open/closed circuit</div></b></u><br><div class="small">dc circuit has two sides coming from the battery<br>
negative and positive sides<br>
an open circuit wouldnt work because the negative side isnt connected to the positive one
</div></p></div><br>
<div class="paragraph" id="flow">
<p><u><b><div class="big">flow and resistance</div></b></u><br><div class="small">voltage is the amount of electrones in a battery<br>
measured with volts (v) <br>
current is the amount of electrones flowing (the same as water pressure kinda) it is measured with amperes (i)<br>
resistance is the material used to flow the electrones it is measured with ohms (r)
</div></p></div><br>

<div class="paragraph" id="resistors">
<p><u><b><div class="big">resistors</div></b></u><br><div class="small">resistors (as shown below)</div></center><img width="100" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41MITTWMTBL._SY355_.jpg"><center><br>
<div class="paragraph">are different materials connected to a circuit to reduce the current (so the components wont overheat or explode)<br>
resistors have different lines on them that represent the amount of voltage it resists.<br>
this chart explains it, the first line is a digit we take from the chart, we add the second one to the right of the first one<br>
for example if i got 3 and 5 it will be 35<br>
the third line is used to multipy the first 2<br> and the third means how accurate it is<br>if there are 5 lines usually the first two lines are counted as the 1st and it goes on<br></div></center><img src="resources/color-codes.png"><center><br>
