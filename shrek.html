Shrek: "Once upon a time, there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle, guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from the dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep, in the highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love and true love's first kiss." [Laughing] Like that's ever gonna happen.

Steve Harwell: ♪ Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead. The years start comin', and they don't stop comin', fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin', didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with takin' the backstreets. You'll never know if you don't go, you'll never shine if you don't glow. Hey, now, you're an all-star. Get your game on, go play. Hey, now, you're a rock star. Get the show on, get paid. And all that glitters is gold, only shootin' stars break the mold. It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder, you're bundled up now, but wait till you get older. But the meteor men beg to differ judging by the hole in the satellite picture. The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin, the water's getting warm so you might as well swim. My world's on fire, how 'bout yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored. Hey, now, you're an all-star. ♪

Donkey: [Chuckles] Can I say somethin' to you? Listen, you was really, really somethin' back there. Incredible!
<br>
Shrek: Are you talkin' to-- me? Whoa!
<br>
Donkey: Yes, I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you was great back there? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, then bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babies in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.
<br>
Shrek: Oh, that's great. Really.
<br>
Donkey: Man, it's good to be free.
<br>
Shrek: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
<br>
Donkey: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.
<br>

<br>
Donkey: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause your breath stinks! Man, you almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time-- [Mumbling] Then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my butt that day.

Shrek: Why are you following me?
<br>
Donkey: I'll tell you why. ♪ 'Cause I'm all alone. There's no one here beside me. My problems have all gone, there's no one to deride me. But you gotta have friends-- ♪
<br>
Shrek: Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.
<br>
Donkey: Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.
<br>
Shrek: Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?
<br>
Donkey: Uh-- Really tall?
<br>
Shrek: No! I'm an ogre. You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you?

Donkey: Really, really.

Shrek: Oh.

Donkey: Man, I like you. What's your name?
<br>
Shrek: Uh, Shrek.
<br>
Donkey: Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. Who'd want to live in a place like that?
<br>
Shrek: That would be my home.
<br>
Donkey: Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you?
<br>
Shrek: I like my privacy.
<br>
Donkey: You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like, I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You're trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. You know? Can I stay with you?
<br>
Shrek: Uh, what?
<br>
Donkey: Can I stay with you? Please?
<br>
Shrek: Of course!
<br>
Donkey: Really?
<br>
Shrek: No.

<br>
Shrek: Okay! Okay! But one night only.
<br>
Donkey: Ah! Thank you!
<br>
Shrek: What are you-- No. No.
<br>
Donkey: This is gonna be fun. We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin', I'm makin' waffles.
<br>
Shrek: Oh!
<br>
Donkey: Where do, uh, I sleep?
<br>
Shrek: Outside!
<br>
Donkey: Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, I guess outside is best. [Sniffles] Here I go. Good night. [Sighs] I mean, I do like the outdoors.

Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! And last, but certainly not the least, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead, from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But, don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

Donkey: What makes it you think she'll be there?

Donkey: You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

Shrek: We? Donkey, there is no "we." There's no "our." There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.
<br>
Donkey: You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.

<br>
Fiona: No. I-- I've been this way as long as I can remember.
<br>
Donkey: What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.
<br>
Fiona: It only happens when the sun goes down. "By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm, until you find true love's first kiss, and then take love's true form."
<br>
Donkey: Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.
<br>
Fiona: It's a spell. [Sighs] When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this. [Sobs]
<br>
Donkey: All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.
<br>
Fiona: But, Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look.
<br>
Donkey: Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?
<br>
Fiona: I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.
<br>
Donkey: But, you know, um, you're kind of an ogre, and Shrek-- well, you got a lot in common.
<br>
Fiona: Shrek?
<br>
Shrek: Princess, I-- Uh, how's going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and-- well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd-- uh, uh-- [Sighs] I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.
<br>
Fiona: I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek. My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.
<br>
[Deep Sigh]
<br>
Fiona: Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.
<br>
Donkey: You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
<br>
Fiona: No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

Donkey: What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?
<br>
Fiona: Promise you won't tell. Promise!
